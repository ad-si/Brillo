{-| Set up the OpenGL context, clear the buffer, and render the given picture
  into it.

  This is the same as `renderPicture` composed with `withModelview`
  and `withClearBuffer`. If you want to manage your own OpenGL context then
  you can just call `renderPicture`.

  Using this function assumes that you've already opened a window
  and set that to the active context. If you don't want to do your own window
  management then use the @brillo@ package instead.
