{-| Open a new window and display an infrequently updated picture.

  Once the window is open you can use the same commands as with @display@.

  * This wrapper is intended for mostly static pictures that do not
    need to be updated more than once per second. For example, the picture
    could show network activity over the last minute, a daily stock price,
    or a weather forecast. If you want to show a real-time animation where
    the frames are redrawn more frequently then use the `animate` wrapper
    instead.

  * The provided picture generating action will be invoked, and the
    display redrawn in two situation:
    1) We receive a display event, like someone clicks on the window.
    2) When `controllerSetRedraw` has been set, some indeterminate time
    between the last redraw, and one second from that.

  * Note that calling `controllerSetRedraw` indicates that the picture should
    be redrawn, but does not cause this to happen immediately, due to
    limitations in the GLFW window manager. The display runs on
    a one second timer interrupt, and if there have been no display events
    we need to wait for the next timer interrupt before redrawing.
    Having the timer interrupt period at 1 second keeps the CPU usage
    due to the context switches at under 1%.

  * Also note that the picture generating action is called for every display
    event, so if the user pans the display then it will be invoked at 10hz
    or more during the pan. If you are generating the picture by reading some
    on-disk files then you should track when the files were last updated
    and cache the picture between updates. Caching the picture avoids
    repeatedly reading and re-parsing your files during a pan. Consider
    storing your current picture in an IORef, passing an action that just
    reads this IORef, and forking a new thread that watches your files for updates.
